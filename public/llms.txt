## Products

### Tastory (Major Project)
A food-based platform. Development is fully completed; currently seeking funding for launch.

### FISCLOK (Side Project)
A completely free finance management mobile app for Android. Born from a personal need — the founder needed a better way to track expenses during the startup journey. All user data is stored locally on the device using MMKV storage — no permissions required, no data collection.

Key features: expense tracking, customizable spending categories, monthly budget limits, lend & borrow (loan) management with repayment tracking, financial health charts with month-on-month comparison, multi-currency support, data transfer, animated dashboard, and complete transaction history.

Developed in 1 month with 2 months of testing before release.
